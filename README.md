Magical Cobble & Bricks – A Touch of Enchantment for Your Builds

This mod adds a growing selection of magical-looking cobblestone and brick blocks – perfect for witches' homes, ancient temples, or enchanted garden paths.
Soft glowing colors, mystical textures, and subtle patterns give your structures a unique, magical atmosphere without overloading them with detail.

The mod is still a work in progress, with more blocks and styles planned – ideal for builders who want to add a hint of magic, one stone at a time.
